# course-notes

This is an easily-accessible, public repository intended to store course notes I've written during my graduate studies in physics. 

The course notes include:
 * Quantum Mechanics I - CMU 33-755;  taught by Gregg Franklin in Fall 2017
 * Quantum Mechanics II - CMU 33-756;  taught by Gregg Franklin in Spring 2018
 * Classical Electrodynamics I - CMU 33-761; taught by James Russ in Fall 2017
 * Statistical Physics - CMU 33-765; taught by Markus Deserno in Spring 2018

The notes are designed to provide a consolidated, but comprehensive review of the course material, including lecture and supplemental information. It is by no means designed to act as a substitute for the course lectures or text. I find the notes most useful when reviewing for exams, or as a reference after the course.

I've highlighted what I thought were key definitions or equations throughout the notes. These are bits of information which you might apply directly to course homeworks or exams.

Please email mho1@andrew.cmu.edu for questions or errata.
